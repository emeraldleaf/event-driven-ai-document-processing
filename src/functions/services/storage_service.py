Azure Storage and Service Bus Integration Service

This service demonstrates distributed storage and event-driven messaging patterns:

1. BLOB STORAGE AS EVENT SOURCE:
   - Documents stored in blob storage trigger events
   - Event Grid monitors blob operations (create, delete, etc.)
   - Decouples upload from processing (temporal decoupling)
   - Enables asynchronous processing pipeline

2. LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT:
   - Documents move through stages: incoming -> processed/failed
   - Automatic archiving via Azure Storage lifecycle policies
   - Immutable audit trail of all processing attempts
   - Separation of concerns (hot vs cold storage)

3. SERVICE BUS MESSAGING:
   - Guaranteed message delivery (at-least-once semantics)
   - Dead letter queues for failed messages
   - Asynchronous notification pattern (fire-and-forget)
   - Decouples producer from consumer

4. DISTRIBUTED STORAGE PATTERNS:
   - Content-addressable storage with unique blob names
   - Metadata stored separately (Cosmos DB) from content (Blob Storage)
   - Optimistic concurrency with ETags
   - Geo-redundant storage for disaster recovery

5. ERROR HANDLING:
   - Non-critical operations don't fail entire pipeline
   - Separate storage containers for different states (triage pattern)
   - Metadata preservation on failures for debugging

    Service for interacting with Azure Blob Storage and Service Bus.

    DISTRIBUTED STORAGE ARCHITECTURE:

    This service manages the storage lifecycle in an event-driven system:

    Upload Flow:
    1. Client uploads to incoming container (EVENT SOURCE)
    2. Event Grid detects blob creation (EVENT DETECTION)
    3. Event published to Service Bus (EVENT DISTRIBUTION)
    4. Function processes document (EVENT PROCESSING)
    5. Blob moved to processed/failed container (STATE TRANSITION)

    STORAGE TIERS:
    - Incoming: Hot tier, short retention
    - Processed: Cool tier after 30 days, archive after 90 days
    - Failed: Requires manual intervention, metadata preserved

    MESSAGING PATTERNS:
    - Service Bus provides reliable, ordered message delivery
    - Completion notifications enable downstream workflows
    - Pub/sub pattern allows multiple consumers

        DISTRIBUTED STORAGE PATTERN:

        - Separation of concerns: storage vs indexing

        PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS:
        - Downloads entire file into memory (suitable for <100MB documents)
        - For larger files, use streaming APIs
        - Blob storage provides low-latency access (<100ms typical)
        - Content cached at edge locations (CDN) if enabled
